## DevOps Principles

### 1. Culture and Collaboration

Everyone works together instead of developement side just "throwing" code to the operations side. The entire team has **shared responsibility** such that if something breaks then its everyone's problem and if it works then its everyone's win. So there needs to be "trust" and "communication" between the team, constantly and with an open mindset (instead of blaming others).

### 2. Automation

Don't repeat tasks if they can be automated. This is done via **IaC** (writing code to set up servers instead of clicking buttons) and **Automated Pipelines** (code gets automatically tested to being ready without needing human intervention). 

### 3. Continuous Everything

- **Continuous Integration** - Build constantly. As soon as developers write new code, they should add it to the main project (*many times a day*). Everytime code is added, a CI pipeline is run which automatically builds/tests the app to make sure nothing broke.
- **Continuous Delivery** - Ready to go instantly. Goal is to get your app in an "always ready" state to be released to customers. 
- **Continuous Deployment** - 
- **Continuous Testing** - Test every piece of code, then test in
- **Continuous Monitoring**
