# File Management in Linux

## xdg-utils (Cross Desktop Group)

A set of command-line tools, designed to work across multiple desktop environments (like GNOME, KDE, XFCE, etc.) for interacting with the userâ€™s system in a desktop-agnostic way.

`xdg-open` and `xdg-email` are the most useful ones. They are used to open files/websites and emails in the default application, respectively.

There is also `xdg-settings` and `xdg-mime` for setting/checking defaults.
