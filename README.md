# DevOps 

It is a culture/process whose main goal is to develop, release and maintain software with maximum quality and speed, via automation tools.

There are 2 groups of software engineers:
1. **Development (Dev group)** --> planning, coding, building and testing.
    - Business and System Analyst
    - Software Architects
    - Developers
    - Build Engineer
    - Test Engineers and QA
2. **Operations (Ops group)** --> release, deployment, operation and monitoring.
    - Release Engineers
    - Configuration Engineer
    - System Admin
    - Database Admin
    - Network Admin

*DevOps* is a then a combination of "development" and "operations", which is to implement collaboration between these two teams. Done by continuous development, build, test and release of software.
